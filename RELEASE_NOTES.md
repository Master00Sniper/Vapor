## What's New in v0.3.7

### New Features

- Live temperature display on Thermal tab shows current GPU and CPU temps, updated every 10 seconds

### Improvements

- Faster startup when running as admin: UAC prompt now appears before splash screen instead of after
- Settings window automatically saves and closes when a game starts (reduces resource usage during gaming)
- Telemetry opt-out option is now hidden behind a Konami code easter egg (up up down down left right left right on Preferences tab)
- All notification and resource apps are now toggled off by default (users opt-in to which apps they want managed)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed fuzzy taskbar icon by adding higher resolution sizes (up to 256x256) to the application icon
